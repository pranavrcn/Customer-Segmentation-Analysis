In this project, I conducted a comprehensive clustering analysis to categorize international customers based on their purchasing behaviors. The analysis started with data cleaning, missing value handling, and feature engineering, where key metrics such as total transactions, total sales, and cart values were aggregated at the customer level. I further enriched the dataset by incorporating RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, which provided insights into customer engagement and value. To address the high dimensionality introduced by item-level data, I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the features, ensuring that 95% of the original variance was retained.

The customer segmentation was achieved using K-Means clustering, where the optimal number of clusters was determined through the Elbow Method. The final model identified three distinct customer segments, validated by Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index metrics. This segmentation allows for more targeted marketing strategies, improving customer engagement and sales potential. Visualization of the clusters further revealed meaningful distinctions between customer groups, making the model actionable for real-world marketing efforts.
